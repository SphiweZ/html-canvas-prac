                                    <p>I have had the opportunity to teach courses like <em>Development, Environment,
                                        and Women</em> and <em>Clinical Sociology</em>, helping students engage with
                                        important sociological concepts. My teaching experience includes using Learning
                                        Management Systems like Sakai and facilitating online classes through platforms
                                        such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, ensuring adaptable and accessible learning
                                        environments. </p>
                                        
                                     <p>My research interests focus on utilizing data visualization and
                                        Python programming to analyze complex social phenomena, particularly in the
                                        fields of Resource Scarcity, Rentier Captitalism and Systems Thinking. I am particularly interested
                                        in how data-driven insights can inform public policy and enhance the
                                        understanding of social dynamics, using systems thinking to connect quantitative
                                        and qualitative methodologies in sociological research.</p>
